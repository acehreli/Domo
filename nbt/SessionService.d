 * Brief:     Support for the NBT Session Service
 * Details:
 *  The NBT Session Service provides for the establishment and maintenance
 *  of NetBIOS sessions over TCP, including the framing of NetBIOS session
 *  messages.
 *
 *  NBT Session Service messages all have the same general format.  They
 *  all start with a 4-octet header followed by 0 or more octets of
 *  additional data.  The number of octets of additional data is given in
 *  the length field.
 *
 *  The header is given in Network Byte Order, and is split into
 *  three subfields:
 *    - Type (8 bits)
 *    - Flags (7 bits)
 *    - Length (17 bits)
 *
 *  In RFC1002, the Flags field is listed as being 8 bits wide, but the
 *  lowest order bit is a "length extension" which is used as the high-
 *  order bit of the Length field.  None of the other Flags bits have
 *  ever been defined.  It makes sense, therefore, to view the Length
 *  field as being 17 bytes, and the Flags field as "Reserved, Must Be
 *  Zero".
