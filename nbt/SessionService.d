 * Brief:     NBT Session Service
 *
 * Details:
 *  The NBT Session Service provides for the establishment and maintenance
 *  of NetBIOS sessions over TCP, including the framing of NetBIOS session
 *  messages.
 *
 *  The Session Service is probably the simplest aspect of the NBT
 *  transport suite.  There are only six possible messages, most of which
 *  have a fixed length:
 *  <ul>
 *    <li>Session Message (4 octet header + variable length user data)
 *    <li>Session Request (72 octets)
 *    <li>Positive Session Response (4 octets)
 *    <li>Negative Session Response (5 octets)
 *    <li>Retarget Session Response (10 octets)
 *    <li>Session Keepalive (4 octets)
 *  </ul>
 *  NBT Session Service messages all have the same general format.  They
 *  all start with a 4-octet header followed by 0 or more octets of
 *  additional data.  The number of octets of additional data is given in
 *  the length field.
 *
 *  The header is in Network Byte Order, and is split into three subfields:
 *  <ul>
 *    <li>Type (8 bits)
 *    <li>Flags (7 bits)
 *    <li>Length (17 bits)
 *  </ul>
 *  In RFC1002, the Flags field is listed as being 8 bits wide, but the
 *  lowest order bit is a "length extension" which is used as the high-
 *  order bit of the Length field.  None of the other Flags bits have
 *  ever been defined.  It makes sense, therefore, to view the Length
 *  field as being 17 bytes, and the first 7 bits of the Flags field as
 *  "Reserved, Must Be Zero".
